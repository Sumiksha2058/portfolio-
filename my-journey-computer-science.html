            <p>Pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA) degree has been one of the most rewarding decisions of my life. In this post, I want to share my journey, the challenges I faced, and the lessons I learned along the way.</p>

            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>I started my BCA program at Tribhuvan University, Kabhre Multiple Campus with a mix of excitement and nervousness. I had always been interested in technology, but I wasn't sure what to expect from a formal computer science education.</p>

            <p>The first semester was challenging. We covered fundamental concepts like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Computer fundamentals and architecture</li>
                <li>Programming basics with C</li>
                <li>Database concepts</li>
                <li>Web technologies introduction</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you." - B.B. King
            </div>

            <h2>Key Learnings</h2>

            <h3>1. Programming is a Skill, Not a Talent</h3>
            <p>I initially thought that programming required some innate talent. However, I quickly realized that it's a skill that can be developed through consistent practice. The key is to <span class="highlight">practice regularly</span> and not get discouraged by failures.</p>

            <h3>2. Problem-Solving Matters More Than Syntax</h3>
            <p>While learning syntax is important, the real skill in programming is learning how to break down problems and solve them logically. I spent more time thinking about how to approach a problem than writing the actual code.</p>

            <h3>3. Collaboration is Essential</h3>
            <p>Working on group projects taught me the importance of collaboration. I learned how to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Communicate effectively with team members</li>
                <li>Manage conflicts and different opinions</li>
                <li>Share knowledge and learn from others</li>
                <li>Use version control systems like Git</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Never Stop Learning</h3>
            <p>The field of computer science is constantly evolving. New frameworks, languages, and technologies emerge regularly. I realized that formal education is just the foundation, and I need to continuously learn and adapt.</p>

            <h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>

            <h3>Imposter Syndrome</h3>
            <p>There were times when I felt like I didn't belong in the computer science field. I would see other students who seemed to understand concepts faster, and I would doubt my abilities. However, I learned that this is a common experience, and the best way to overcome it is to focus on my own progress.</p>

            <h3>Time Management</h3>
            <p>Balancing coursework, projects, and personal life was challenging. I had to learn how to prioritize tasks and manage my time effectively.</p>

            <h3>Keeping Up with Technology</h3>
            <p>The pace of technological change can be overwhelming. I learned to focus on fundamentals first and then gradually explore new technologies.</p>

            <h2>Projects That Made a Difference</h2>

            <p>Throughout my journey, I worked on several projects that helped me solidify my learning:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Portfolio Website</strong> - Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive Games</strong> - Created mind games and quiz applications</li>
                <li><strong>Database Projects</strong> - Designed and implemented database systems</li>
                <li><strong>Web Applications</strong> - Developed full-stack applications</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Advice for Aspiring Computer Science Students</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Start with the basics</strong> - Don't jump into advanced topics without understanding fundamentals</li>
                <li><strong>Practice coding daily</strong> - Even 30 minutes of coding every day is better than cramming</li>
                <li><strong>Build projects</strong> - Apply what you learn by building real projects</li>
                <li><strong>Join communities</strong> - Connect with other students and professionals</li>
                <li><strong>Read others' code</strong> - Learn from how experienced developers write code</li>
                <li><strong>Don't fear failure</strong> - Errors and bugs are part of the learning process</li>
                <li><strong>Stay curious</strong> - Ask questions and explore new technologies</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Looking Forward</h2>

            <p>As I continue my journey in computer science, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead. I want to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Contribute to open-source projects</li>
                <li>Build applications that solve real-world problems</li>
                <li>Mentor other students who are starting their journey</li>
                <li>Continue learning and growing as a developer</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>My journey as a computer science student has taught me that success is not about being the smartest person in the room, but about being persistent, curious, and willing to learn. If you're considering pursuing computer science, I encourage you to take the leap. It's a challenging but incredibly rewarding path.</p>

            <p>Remember, every expert was once a beginner. Keep coding, keep learning, and keep growing!</p>
